# Deep-Learning-Basics
This repository includes some of the fundamental things that one should know while working on Deep Learning.
********** Haarcascade ************
To run Python files for Haar cascade face and smile detection, you need to have the following prerequisites and downloads:

Python: Install Python, which can be downloaded from the official Python website (https://www.python.org). You can choose the version that is compatible with your operating system.

OpenCV: OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a popular computer vision library that includes Haar cascades for face and smile detection. You can install OpenCV using pip, the Python package manager, by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
pip install opencv-python
Haar Cascades: Haar cascades are XML files that contain pre-trained classifiers for various objects, including faces and smiles. Download the Haar cascade files for face and smile detection from the OpenCV GitHub repository:

Haar cascade for face detection: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml
Haar cascade for smile detection: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_smile.xml

Instead, you can download all the available haarcascade files, but include their path location in your code. Save these XML files in the same directory as your Python script or provide the correct path to these files in your code.

*********** Tkinter *************
pip install tk

*The code files in haarcascade and tkinter folders can be run on a local Python IDE on your system. Note that it cannot be run on Google Colab

*********** Other files *************
All the other files can be run on google Colab.
For some of the files, make sure to download an API key from your Kaggle account and upload it in the files section of your Google Colab. One distinct advantage of running them on Google Colab is that you won't have to download each and every library that you wish to make use of.
